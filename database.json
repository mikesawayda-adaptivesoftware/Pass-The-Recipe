I recommend this loaf pan.\r\nNotes\r\nFor best results, please weigh your ingredients with a scale instead of using measuring cups. \r\nHere's why: weight and volume measurements are not equal, only approximate! This is especially important regarding the sourdough starter. If your starter is very bubbly, 1/4 cup might only weigh 30 g which is too little for this recipe (you need 50 g). The dough will take forever to rise! Same goes for the flour... 4 cups might end up weighing way over 500 g depending on how tight the flour was packed into the cup. You'll end up with dry dough.\r\nI used Whole Foods 365 Everyday all purpose flour for this recipe. King Arthur and Trader Joe's ap flour will work as well.

You can use any kind of pork bone as long as it contains marrow. Neck bones are the easiest to find at American supermarkets. Just make sure that your bones do not have a lot of excess meat on them. A little bit of meat on the neck bones is totally fine, but it shouldn\u2019t be so much that you could make a meal of it.\n1 bunch green onion, cut in quarters\n1 large yellow onion, cut in half\n2 shallots, cut in half\n2 3-inch knob ginger, peeled\n4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed\n16 oz Sliced Mushrooms\nNotes: Wood ear mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms are traditional in ramen, but I REALLY DISLIKED the dried kind.

Place pork of choice in bowl and cover with marinade. Marinate pork for at least 24 hours in the fridge. Flip pork half-way through to evenly marinate.\nTare:\nTare is the seasoning of your ramen to give it salty and umami components.\nIn small storage container, put in 1 cup filtered water, 3 2-square inch pieces of kombu, and 10 slices of shiitake mushrooms and get everything wet. Put the lid on the container and steep overnight in the fridge for 24 hours.\nBlack Garlic Oil:\nPrepare a plate with some paper towels on it to put the fried garlic on.\nHeat \u00bd cup canola oil in saucepan on medium heat.\nOnce hot, put \u00bd cup garlic chips in oil. You will want to stir every 30 seconds or so to make sure the garlic browns evenly.\nYou will need to watch for the color of the garlic and take out \u00bc of the garlic onto the plate in four different intervals based on the color of the garlic: Light brown, brown, dark brown, black (yes literally black, but not a second more or else it will turn to char!)\nYou should now have four piles of different colored garlic. Place all garlic in a spice grinder and grind until you get very small granules, like ground coffee. \nMix the ground garlic with the canola oil from the pot and \u00bd cup fresh sesame oil and let the garlic rest in the oil for about an hour.\nUsing a fine mesh strainer, or two if you can, along with a funnel, strain and pour garlic oil into glass bottle and store it in the fridge for up to 3 months.\nTonkotsu Broth:\nYou could technically do this on day two, but that just leaves a lot of work for day two.\nTake 1lb trotters and 4 lb pork bones out of fridge so that they can warm up a bit.\nIn large stock pot, fill about \u2154 way with tap water and bring it up to a boil. This takes a while to boil, so placing a lid on top will make it boil faster. You must be patient and wait for a rolling boil because when you throw the bones in, it will drastically lower the temperature of the water.\nPlace trotters and bones in boiling water, stir them around, and place lid on top of pot until it comes back to a boil. Remove lid and then start timer for 10 minutes to blanch the bones.\nSome \u201cscum\u201d will start to form at the top of the water. Scum is the pink/brown/white thick foam that will rise to the surface of the water. About 5 minutes into the boiling process after some of the scum has coagulated, take a fine mesh strainer to skim off the scum and then mix around the bones again. After another 5 minutes, skim the scum again, mix the bones up to release anymore scum, and then immediately drain into large colander.\nThoroughly rinse bones in cold water and use fingers to scrape off any excess scum or yucky dark bits that you don\u2019t want in your broth. You\u2019ll want to be pretty OCD during this step to have a nice white milky broth at the end.\nPlace trotters and pork bones into instant pot and fill with 3.5 quarts of filtered water. Do your best to use filtered water since 99% of the broth is water. Bad water = bad broth.\nPut lid on instant pot and pressure cook on the meat/stew setting on low (use the adjust button to switch to low) for 90 minutes.\nWhile this goes, prepare your aromatics per the ingredient list instructions.\nAfter 90 minutes, depressurize instant pot, open it, and leave the lid off for these next steps.\nPut two more cups of water into instant pot.\nPlace all aromatics in and give everything a mix. Turn instant pot on meat/stew setting on Normal for 60 minutes to bring everything to a rolling boil. Stir occasionally to prevent anything sticking to the bottom. Note: The rolling boil creates an emulsion between the water and the oil to create that white, creamy, thick tonkotsu broth.\nAfter 60 minutes, your broth should be white and creamy looking. If it didn\u2019t turn white and cloudy, then you didn\u2019t boil it hot enough. If it\u2019s more of a brown color, then you didn\u2019t clean the bones well enough or there was too much meat on the bones. But don\u2019t expect to get a perfect white broth. A bit of beige color is passable.\nUse a slotted spoon, not a fine strainer, to take out all the big bits in the broth, such as the bones, trotters, aromatics. Pick out mushrooms and place them in a storage container for toppings later.\nWhile the broth is still very hot, use an immersion blender all around the pot to blend up any tiny chunks left (for flavor) and more importantly to create an even stronger emulsion.\nUse two fine mesh strainers to double strain the broth into a large storage bowl, either metal or thick plastic that is resistant to heat. If you don\u2019t have two fine mesh strainers, then make sure to strain the broth twice. There should be a lot of pulp in the broth and you\u2019ll need to work the liquid through. Once you have worked all the liquid through and all you have left is pulp, you can do one of two things based on personal preference. You can squeeze the pulp dry to extract as much liquid and flavor out of the pulp as possible, or if you want a super white broth, then don\u2019t squeeze the pulp. Since I\u2019m not trying to sell this ramen nor am I trying to impress anyone with my super white broth, I choose to squeeze my pulp for extra flavor.\nPlace lid or plastic wrap on bowl and set in fridge immediately to cool off to prevent any bacteria from forming. Some people like to put the broth bowl in an even larger bowl filled with ice water to cool down the broth quickly to prevent as little bacteria growth as possible, but unless you are freezing the broth (which you can do) to store it for a long time, I wouldn't be too concerned about bacteria growth.", "summary": "Day 1"}, {"created_at": "2025-03-13T21:06:29.525970", "update_at": "2025-03-13T21:06:29.525971", "id": "cf86a24578654db58b1acb1cb09ae1c7", "recipe_id": "25ccb959987148ef845d4ce7a441032a", "position": 2, "type": "", "title": "", "text": "Check your tonkotsu broth.

Flip every hour and stir marinade occasionally. Make sure there are no aromatics underneath the pork or else they may burn.\nAfter cooking, transfer pork to large container with a small amount of marinade just to keep moist. Transfer the rest of the marinade to a storage container. Place pork and marinade in fridge to cool.\nSoft Boiled Egg:\nRight after your pork has begun to cook, start the eggs because they will need time to marinate. You could make the eggs on day one and marinate overnight, but it could get a bit too salty.\nBring small pot to rapid boil before putting in eggs.\nBoil 6 eggs for 6 minutes and 30 seconds exactly.\nTake pot over to sink and pour cold water over the eggs until they have cooled down enough for you to peel them.\nPlace eggs into small zip-loc bag and pour the marinade ingredients into bag.\nSqueeze as much air out of the bag as possible and place eggs in fridge.\nTare:\nIdeally, you should time your tare to be done at the same time that your chashu is done. It takes about 20 minutes to make the tare.\nPlace tare liquid in saucepan and squeeze out liquid from kombu and mushrooms as much as you can.\nSlowly bring tare to a low simmer.\nOnce it is at a simmer, cut the heat and add in \u00bd cup bonito flakes and steep for 10 minutes. You can keep the pot on the burner, just turn the heat off and make sure the liquid isn\u2019t bubbling.\nUsing fine mesh strainer, strain the tare into storage container and squeeze liquid from pulp. \nMix in remaining tare ingredients. Season with salt to make it too salty. It should be so salty that it stings your tongue, but still very tasty. This will be the only source of salt in your entire dish, so it should be very salty. If you are concerned that you might make it too salty, then be conservative and you can add extra salt to your ramen at the end. Place in fridge.\nAssembly:\nFinally it\u2019s time to eat! Get your large ramen bowl and place in a as much tonkotsu broth as you want. I store my broth in a round bowl and it cools solid, so I cut out a \u201cpie\u201d sized piece into my bowl.\nPut bowl in microwave for about 2 minutes to melt the broth.\nBoil small pot of water and boil about a half-handful of noodles for 4 minutes.

Add 1 tablespoon of chashu marinade. Add \u00bd to 1 tablespoon of black garlic oil. Taste the soup. If it isn\u2019t salty enough and you have already added in 3 tablespoons of tare, then your tare isn\u2019t salty enough. Don\u2019t add more than 3 tablespoons of tare or else you won\u2019t be able to taste the pork broth anymore. Just add some more salt to your ramen and add more salt to the tare for next time.\nPlace ramen back in microwave to heat until everything is super hot.\nAdd in your noodles and both halves of an egg.
